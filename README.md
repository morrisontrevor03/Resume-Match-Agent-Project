## Overview
Currently developing an AI agent that matches job descriptions with the users resume. The inputs are passed to the OpenAI Responses API to generate a match score and list of mismatched requirements.

## Roadmap
1. Wrap this basic logic into an API
2. Develop a frontend where users can add a pdf of their resume as well as add the job description text
2. Generate a new and improved resume that optimizes their job match while remaining truthful; potentially add capability to read linkedin and/or github to give the model more insight on the user
3. Create a chrome extension that the user can quickly use to generate a report without switching tabs
